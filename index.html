            The <b>PlayStation 2</b> (PS2) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Interactive
            Entertainment. It was first released in Japan on March 4, 2000, in North America on October 26, 2000, and in
            Europe and Australia on November 24, 2000, and is the successor to the original PlayStation, as well as the
            second installment in the PlayStation console line-up. As a sixth-generation console, the PS2 competed with
            Sega's Dreamcast, Nintendo's GameCube, and Microsoft's original Xbox.

            Announced in 1999, the PS2 offered backwards compatibility for its predecessor's DualShock controller, as
            well as its games. The PS2 is the best-selling video game console of all time, having sold around 150
            million units worldwide, as confirmed by Sony. Over 3,800 game titles have been released for the PS2,
            with over 1.5 billion copies sold. Sony later manufactured several smaller, lighter revisions of the
            console known as Slimline models in 2004.

            Even with the release of its successor, the PlayStation 3, the PS2 remained popular well into the seventh
            generation, and continued to be produced until 2013, when Sony finally announced it had been discontinued
            after twelve years of production â€“ one of the longest lifespans of a video game console. Despite the
            announcement, new games for the console continued to be produced until the end of 2013, including Final
            Fantasy XI: Seekers of Adoulin for Japan, FIFA 13 for North America, and Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 for
            Europe. Repair services for the system in Japan ended on September 7, 2018.
